 Given N lecture timings, with their start time and end time (both inclusive), the task is to find the minimum number of halls required to hold all the classes such that a single hall can be used for only one lecture at a given time. Note that the maximum end time can be 105.
Examples: 
 

Input: lectures[][] = {{0, 5}, {1, 2}, {1, 10}} 
Output: 3 
All lectures must be held in different halls because 
at time instance 1 all lectures are ongoing.
Input: lectures[][] = {{0, 5}, {1, 2}, {6, 10}} 
Output: 2
