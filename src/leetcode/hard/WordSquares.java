Given a 2D grid of characters and a word, find all occurrences of the given word in the grid. A word can be matched in all 8 directions at any point. Word is said to be found in a direction if all characters match in this direction (not in zig-zag form).
The 8 directions are, Horizontally Left, Horizontally Right, Vertically Up, Vertically Down and 4 Diagonal directions.
Example: 

Input:  grid[][] = {"GEEKSFORGEEKS",
                    "GEEKSQUIZGEEK",
                    "IDEQAPRACTICE"};
        word = "GEEKS"

Output: pattern found at 0, 0
        pattern found at 0, 8
        pattern found at 1, 0
Explanation: 'GEEKS' can be found as prefix of
1st 2 rows and suffix of first row

Input:  grid[][] = {"GEEKSFORGEEKS",
                    "GEEKSQUIZGEEK",
                    "IDEQAPRACTICE"};
        word = "EEE"

Output: pattern found at 0, 2
        pattern found at 0, 10
        pattern found at 2, 2
        pattern found at 2, 12
Explanation: EEE can be found in first row 
twice at index 2 and index 10
and in second row at 2 and 12
