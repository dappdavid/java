We are given a Trie with a set of strings stored in it. Now the user types in a prefix of his search query, we need to give him all recommendations to auto-complete his query based on the strings stored in the Trie. We assume that the Trie stores past searches by the users.
For example if the Trie store {�abc�, �abcd�, �aa�, �abbbaba�} and the User types in �ab� then he must be shown {�abc�, �abcd�, �abbbaba�}.
Prerequisite Trie Search and Insert.
