# List of Big O space complexities
1. Constant Space (O(1)): The amount of memory used does not change with the size of the input data.
2. Linear Space (O(n)): The amount of memory used is proportional to the size of the input data.
3. Quadratic Space (O(nÂ²)): The amount of memory used is proportional to the square of the size of the input data.
4. Logarithmic Space (O(log n)): Rare, but occurs when the memory used grows logarithmically with the input size.
5. Exponential Space (O(2^n)): The memory used grows exponentially with the input size.
