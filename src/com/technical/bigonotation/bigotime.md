# List of Big O time complexities
1. Constant Time (O(1)): The algorithm's performance is constant, unaffected by the size of the input data.
2. Logarithmic Time (O(log n)): The algorithm's performance increases logarithmically with the size of the input data.
3. Linear Time (O(n)): The algorithm's performance is directly proportional to the size of the input data.
4. Linearithmic Time (O(n log n)): A combination of linear and logarithmic time.
5. Quadratic Time (O(n²)): The algorithm's performance is proportional to the square of the size of the input data.
6. Cubic Time (O(n³)): The performance is proportional to the cube of the size of the input data.
7. Exponential Time (O(2^n)): The algorithm's performance doubles with each addition to the input data set.
8. Factorial Time (O(n!)): The performance is proportional to the factorial of the size of the input data.
